# Sandesh-Cybersecurity-Portfolio
I am a recent CompTIA Security + Certified with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. My journey in Cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

## Professional Statements
I am Sandesh Kumar. I am an Senior Application Support Analyst at Scotiabank. I provide IT technical support (Azure, Intune, Exchange, Entra ID), database extraction (SQL), and cyber security support.  

Recently, I completed the Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats. 

As of 2025, I am preparing to take the `Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)`, Certified in `CompTIA Security+` certifications 2024.
